# phishing-website-detection
This project uses machine learning to detect phishing websites by analyzing features like URL patterns, domain age, HTTPS presence, and more. Built with Python, it trains a classifier to distinguish between legitimate and malicious sites for improved online safety.
This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques by analyzing website-related features. Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, tricking users into providing sensitive information through fake websites. Our solution uses a trained machine learning model to distinguish between legitimate and malicious websites based on features extracted from their URLs and metadata.

🧠 Features Used
The model analyzes various features such as:

Presence of HTTPS

Length and structure of the URL

Use of IP addresses instead of domain names

Age of domain and DNS records

Use of special characters and subdomains

External resource links and redirection patterns

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Scikit-learn (machine learning models)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for experiments and results)

🧪 Model & Evaluation
We experimented with several classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,XGBoost and Support Vector Machine. The best-performing model achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall on the testing dataset.

📊 Results
The final model was able to detect phishing websites with an accuracy of over 80%, making it reliable for real-world applications. The confusion matrix and ROC curve were used to validate model performance.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository

Install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook phishing_detection.ipynb  
Test the model using the test dataset or try a custom URL input (if feature extractor is provided).

🔐 Future Improvements
Add real-time URL input and feature extraction

Create a browser extension or web app

Train with larger, updated datasets
